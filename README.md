# üìä Automated EDA with YData Profiling

This project demonstrates how to perform **automated exploratory data analysis (EDA)** in Python using the [`ydata-profiling`](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) library (formerly known as `pandas-profiling`).

## üîç What is YData Profiling?

YData Profiling is a powerful tool for quick and interactive EDA. With just a few lines of code, it generates a detailed report that includes:

- Data overview and type inference
- Summary statistics
- Missing value analysis
- Distribution plots
- Correlation heatmaps
- Duplicates detection
- Data quality warnings
### 1. Clone the repository
